## Fake Profile Detection API

---

A feature rich API dedicated towards using Computer Vision techniques on input profile picture and identify potentially fake profiles.

We've focused on the following primary features : 

- Provide different inference models to the users, so they can use the one with a balance of latency and accuracy as per their task.
- Identify false Positives :  Detect cartoon/anime faces in the input images and distinguish them from human faces.
- Provide Additional details about the input image including Age, Gender, Potential Celebrity match, if its AI Generated, etc which might be relevant in fake profile detection.

Read the official documentation [here](https://github.com/labeeb-7z/GeneratingAdversarialThoughts/blob/main/docs.md)

## Future Scope
- Imporve the False positive detection model with a custom dataset : Current model is based on icartoon dataset which does not contain all types of cartoonish/animated face images. The model can be improved by a big margin if its trained on a better dataset.
- Improving the models for latency and providing support for wider variety of input images including sketches, DeepFakes, etc
